# Portfolio-Optimisation
The project focused on generating the Minimum Variance Portfolio on diversely selected Indian stocks. It gave the team a deeper idea on the concepts they learnt from the book like CAPM, Sharpe ratio etc. It was the first project of our team in the field of Quantitative Finance and this really gave us a deeper insight of the practical work that happens in the Industrial level.
