# Portfolio-Optimisation
The project focused on generating the Minimum Variance Portfolio on diversely selected Indian stocks. It gave me a deeper idea on the concepts that I learnt from the book like CAPM, Sharpe ratio etc. It was the first project of mine in the field of Quantitative Finance and this really gave me a deeper insight of the practical work that happens at the Industrial level.
